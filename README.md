 # 👋 Hi everyone
 
I am Rahul from India🙂. I have pursued B.Tech in Civil Engineering from [BIT Sindri](https://www.bitsindri.ac.in/). 

I wanted to be a web developer that's why I chose the path of web development rather than pursuing as a civil engineer in my career.

I am currently working on a [social network application](https://github.com/Rahulbaran/Sakha).

I have a [blog website📝](https://rahulbaran.hashnode.dev/) on [hashnode](https://hashnode.com/), where you can read my articles about various web tools.

I love💛 watching web series and travelling.

 You can checkout my works on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/rahulbaran).
